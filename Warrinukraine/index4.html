            After the end of the war, a very serious political process related to changes in the current Russian Federation will begin: certain regions will be separated from Russia... Moscow will pay reparations to us, this is all waiting for them, it will lead to the shift of a certain economic center of the Russian Federation to our territory... that is, there are many very steps."

            Details: According to Budanov, Caucasians will be the first to secede from the Russian Federation, but it will not be only Caucasians. The head of the GUR believes that there are many territorial problems in Russia: "Russian Federation" is one name for federalism."

            <p class="closeDoor">300 tanks, 700 BMPs, half a thousand howitzers - and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be in position as of February 23. In an interview with The Economist, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi spoke about the needs of the army. He emphasized: he understands exactly how to defeat the enemy. And plans a new military operation, which is already on the way. He spoke about the prospects of the Armed Forces going to the border with Crimea - and the critical need to liberate Melitopol for this. He also noted the importance of the psychological experience gained by our defenders since 2014. Who now have only one desire - the desire to destroy the occupiers.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            "Russians and any other enemies must be killed. Only kill. And most importantly, do not be afraid to do it," said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            And while all the invaders have not been destroyed, they will plan a new offensive. Zaluzhnyi disagreed with the statement that Russian mobilization did not help the Kremlin. After all, they have already collected about 200,000 from the expected reserve of one and a half million. And despite the unprofessionalism of these occupiers, they obediently carry out the king's orders and go into battle. And they will obviously try to go to Kyiv again. But an aggravation can also occur in the Ukrainian east - or the southern direction. So a new level of escalation in the war can be expected this February, in the worst case - at the end of January, and in the best case - in March. And Ukraine should already be working on the accumulation of equipment that we will need for confrontation.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            "Let the soldiers who are currently in the trenches forgive me. But in order to save the country, it is now more important to focus on the accumulation of resources, the preparation of these resources for more protracted and difficult battles that may begin next year," noted the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny.
            The enemy took into account the mistakes and successes of the Armed Forces during the liberation of Kharkiv region and Kherson region. So now the operative plans for capturing all of Ukraine have been changed. And now Russia will focus on entering the administrative borders of the entire Luhansk region and Donetsk region. This is what the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is talking about. And Moscow clearly understood that the previous blitzkrieg plan should be forgotten forever.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            "The Kremlin realizes that in the short term it is impossible to achieve victory in the war, therefore it seeks to turn the conflict into a long-term armed confrontation aimed at exhausting Ukraine and our partners. In order to force our state to negotiate, as well as to create a strategic pause for the recovery and accumulation of its forces , the enemy is not easing the psychological and economic pressure on our country, first of all by launching massive missile and artillery strikes on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine," said Oleksiy Gromov, deputy chief of the main operational department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
            And the enemy continues the terror. Due to shelling of critical infrastructure, Kherson was completely cut off. This was reported in the regional military administration. Russian shells again flew into the city center. They hit the medical point and the point with humanitarian aid. Two people died. Among them is a volunteer. Three more Kherson residents were wounded.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            The enemy is shelling Kherson, pretending to be active in the north, like a zombie climbing into Bakhmut and not counting the dead, because he understands that if the front line is not stretched, this winter will be a disaster for him. This was emphasized by the head of the President's Office. He also noted that Ukraine will go to its goal - the borders of 1991.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            And the Armed Forces continue their work in this direction. Over the past day, almost 600 more occupiers have gone through the accelerated demobilization procedure, and 5 more Russian tanks, 9 armored fighting vehicles, 12 artillery systems, 2 rocket salvo systems, and one unit each of special and automotive equipment have also been destroyed. Another 27 enemy drones were also shot down
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports that in order to restore resources and quickly remove military equipment from conveyors, Russia no longer pursues quality. Obviously, the same will happen with the supply of the occupation contingent. After all, even now near Bakhmut, our soldiers are discovering unexpected souvenirs - fortunately, well forgotten - of the Soviet past.
