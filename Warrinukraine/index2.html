             <p>Despite numerous facts of the participation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and evidence of Russia's involvement in the war, Russia officially did not recognize the fact of its invasion of Ukraine, therefore, from the Ukrainian side, until February 24, 2022, the war was considered undeclared. Some Ukrainian politicians called the war in eastern Ukraine a "hybrid war" of Russia against Ukraine. Legally, the anti-terrorist operation (2014-2018) and the operation of the United Forces continued in the east of Ukraine until February 24, 2022. The Russian authorities have repeatedly stated their disapproval of the Anti-Terrorist Operation and demanded its termination and the start of negotiations with the militants.
             </p><p class="closeDoor">
             The hostilities of the war in Donbas began on April 12, 2014, with the seizure of the Ukrainian cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, and Druzhkivka by Russian units led by officers of the Russian special services, where Russian saboteurs armed local collaborators with weapons seized from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and recruited them into their ranks. In the conditions of non-resistance of the local security forces of Ukraine, and sometimes open cooperation, small assault units of Russian saboteurs took control of Horlivka and other cities of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the following days. On April 13, 2014, in response to the invasion of sabotage units, Acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov announced the start of the Anti-Terrorist Operation. Special units of the SBU and the Armed Forces of Ukraine deployed to the Slovyansk and Kramatorsk regions took part in the first battle on the morning of April 13 in Semenivka, a suburb of Slovyansk, when they were ambushed by pro-Russian militants, in which the SBU captain "Alfa" was killed.

             After a series of unsuccessful major battles in early May 2014 near Slovyansk, where Ukrainian forces lost 2 Mi-24 combat helicopters to the fire of Russian MANPADS, as well as several ambushes, the ATO leadership decided to gradually surround Slovyansk, cutting off the garrison of pro-Russian fighters from supply of weapons from Russia. On May 11, 2014, pro-Russian forces held referendums on the territory of some districts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which raised the issue of supporting the state independence of the sovereign DPR and LPR, which were declared in April. According to the calculations of the referendum organizers, the issue was supported by the voters, and according to independent witnesses, the referendums had all the signs of fictitiousness.

             On June 1, 2014, pro-Russian militants began a several-day assault on the border post in Luhansk, which ended on June 4 with the withdrawal of the Ukrainian garrison from the border post. On June 2, 2014, a series of explosions took place near the headquarters of pro-Russian militants located in the Luhansk Regional State Administration, which also killed civilians. On June 12, the delivery of heavy armored vehicles from the Russian Federation began: a column of tanks arrived in Snizhny, and a column of Grad salvo fire systems passed through Luhansk, which were used for the first time in the war in Donbas the next day — on June 13, Russian fighters fired at the Ukrainian checkpoint near Dobropilly.

             On June 20, 2014, the newly elected President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced the beginning of a ten-day unilateral ceasefire, promising amnesty and freedom from criminal prosecution to all who lay down their arms, the creation of joint units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to ensure public order, decentralization, coordination of heads of regional administrations with representatives of Donbas, early local and parliamentary elections. The pro-Russian militants did not agree to the proposed conditions and did not support the ceasefire.
             </p><p class="closeDoor">
                After the end of 10 days of a unilateral ceasefire, Ukrainian forces completed the encirclement of Sloviansk, forcing a group of Russian militants to retreat to Donetsk on July 5. The headquarters of the ATO began a large-scale operation to establish control over the Russian-Ukrainian border, creating a 15-kilometer zone along the border controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense battalions. At the same time, Ukrainian forces began an operation to unblock the LAP and surround Luhansk.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            On July 11, 2014, against the background of the threat of a complete blockade of the border by Ukrainian forces, Russian regular troops began to participate in the war, delivering a devastating missile strike from their territory to a Ukrainian formation near Zelenopilly, a village a few kilometers from the Russian-Ukrainian border. Since then, the entire line of Ukrainian formations near the border — from the Luhansk region to the coast of the Sea of Azov — during July-August 2014 was under systematic artillery fire from the territory of the Russian Federation, to which the Ukrainian formations did not respond. The shelling caused the supply lines of the Ukrainian group to be cut in the Izvaryny area, leaving significant Ukrainian forces surrounded for weeks. The operation to unblock them was carried out on August 6-7, after which the exhausted units were withdrawn from the combat zone, thus finally losing control over 140 km of the state border.

            As of August 2017, there were constant local battles, which subsided somewhat before the start of the academic year. Almost every day in the mass media (Ukrainian and foreign) there were reports of shelling, wounded and killed. Yes, as of August 30, 2017, there were 21 shellings per day from the ORDLO side.
            </p><p class="closeDoor">
            As of August 2019, hostilities continued. In particular, on August 7, 2019, 4 Ukrainian servicemen were killed near Pavlopol.</p>
