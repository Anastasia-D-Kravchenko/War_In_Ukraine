            <div class="nava1 five">South of Ukraine. When it comes to him, what do we imagine? Sea, beaches, embankments in Odesa or Mykolaiv. We mention Zaliznyi Port, Skadovsk, Chornomorsk. But the southern part of our country is not only the sea, but also incredibly beautiful canyons, nature reserves, tracts, islands and...steppe. "Ukraine is the only country in Europe where you can see the steppes. Many European researchers go to Ukraine to see the steppe. In Switzerland you can see the Alps, in Norway you can see other mountains, but you can see the steppes only here. Hardly anyone from Europe will go beyond the Urals, to see the steppes. For Ukraine, this is a potential that has not yet been revealed," says ecologist Oleksiy Vasylyuk.</div>

            <p class="closeDoor">The steppe is a unique ecosystem, one of the most important on the planet.
                <p class="closeDoor">
                    "All black soils of the planet are formed by steppes. If there were no steppe, there would be no agriculture on our planet.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    If there was no steppe, we might not have humanity.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    Because the entire climate on earth depends on how much atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases the steppe has absorbed, forming chernozems. This is the richest type of nature that can be seen," the ecologist explains.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    It sounds fantastic, but up to 120 plant species can be found on one square meter of the steppe. If you like to photograph flowers and plants, the steppe is the road for you.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    And for those who like to photograph animals or watch them, the road to the Biosphere Reserve "Askania Nova" is a must.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    Getting there is easy, says our interlocutor. You need to get to Kherson, and then at the railway station you can find out how to get to "Ascania" in a matter of tens of minutes.
                </p><p class="closeDoor">
                    The reserve lives by conducting tours, so access there is unlimited. Over the past century and a half, says Vasyliuk, there has been a zoo with wild animals from all continents that inhabit the steppe zones and on other continents.

            <div class="nava1 five2">Those who want to be alone or away from people are advised to go to Dzharylgach. There are several places equipped for tourists with minimal services: there are deckchairs, shelters from the heat. Dzharylgach is located 7 km from Skadovsk. If you are not going to spend the night on the peninsula, but just want to walk around it, you can stay in one of the hotels in this city. The island is partially submerged by the sea. At different times of the day, you can walk here either on dry land or knee-deep in water. Tides and ebbs occur on the island. "There is an interesting place on the territory of the island. There is no more interesting place on the map of Europe than the Pyndyky tract.</div>

            <p>These lakes are perfectly round in shape - about two hundred lakes. If you imagine borscht with oil bubbles floating in it, this is what the Pyndyka tract looks like.
        <p class="closeDoor">
            These are lakes with a diameter of several meters to two kilometers, which are perfectly adjacent to each other and are made of sea washes. No one knows how the tract of such a shape was formed, why it does not change its shape for years," Oleksii Vasylyuk continues.
        </p><p class="closeDoor">
            Dzharylgach is the largest uninhabited island in Europe, the ecologist explains. The national park covers about ten thousand hectares.
        </p><p class="closeDoor">
            "A large number of ungulates live on it - mouflons - small ungulates, similar to mountain rams. They have adapted to the steppe conditions on the island. There are also deer and doe. The island is perfectly flat. There are small trees that can be seen from afar," he adds.
        </p><p class="closeDoor">
            Recently, pink pelicans began to appear on the island. There are two lighthouses on the island. The author of one of them is Eiffel, the author of the famous Paris tower. The founder of the city, Serhiy Skadovsky, ordered the lighthouse in 1902.

            Since then, he has helped the boats not to run aground.

            Now the lighthouse is in a state of emergency, and they periodically want to move it from the island to the mainland, but the matter has not yet progressed beyond words.</p><p class="closeDoor">
